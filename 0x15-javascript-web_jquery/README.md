## JavaScript Web Development using jQuery

This repository contains various examples of web development using jQuery in the JavaScript language. jQuery is a fast, small, and feature-rich JavaScript library. It makes things like HTML document traversal and manipulation, event handling, animation, and Ajax much simpler with an easy-to-use API that works across a multitude of browsers. With a combination of HTML, CSS, and jQuery, you can create dynamic web pages and applications.
